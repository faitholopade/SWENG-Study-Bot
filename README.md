# StudyBot

## Installation and running
To install and run the application you need to:
1. Run the backend by running the StudybotApplication.java file, located in /Backend/studybot/src/main/java/ie/tcd/scss/studybot. If the run throws errors you need to cd into Backend/studybot and run 'mvn clean'.
2. Run the frontend by executing 'npm i' and 'npm dev run' in the Frontend directory. Make sure to have npm installed on your machine.

## Testing
The tests are located at studybot\src\test\java\ie\tcd\scss\studybot and can be run by either right clicking on the java subdirectory and pressing run->run all tests (in IntelliJ IDEA) or running java tests (in VS code) or running 'mvn test' in the directory of tests using the terminal.
